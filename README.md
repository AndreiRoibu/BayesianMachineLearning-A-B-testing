# Bayesian Machine Learning: A/B Testing
## Motivation
This collection respresents a set codes aiding my learning / recap of Bayesian machine learning and A/B testing algorithms, from their derivation to applications. This repo contains codes for high-level bayesian statistics basics, traditional A/B testing, Bayesian A/B testing, as well as some additional other codes.

These codes are inspired by a course created by the [Lazy Programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer). More information can be found at these two links:
